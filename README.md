# ToDoList

An application that allows the addition and deletion of tasks, each task appears in an unorderd list below the input box.

This app was written with jquery, styled with bootstrap. To add a task simply type into the input box and click the button.

The application functions as follows: If a user clicks the pencil icon button while the input box is empty a pop-up message will prompt them to enter a task.
The first letter of each task is capitalized to add uniformity to the items added. If the user has completed a task they can click the task once, this 
will change that elements background colour. The user may click an item again to revert this color change. If the user would like to delete a task completely they
may double click on the task element. After a colour change the task will disappear from the list permanently.
